DP:
A fibonacci series is the sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example, 0,1,1, 2, 3 . Here, each number is the sum of the 
two preceding numbers. Let n be the number of terms.

Using previous experience again if needed, instead of finding the ans of same thing using its previously stored ans is DP.

Instead of wasting recursive calls for finding the same thing again will store the ans of every step in DP[] / DP[][] then using it later if needed again without again 
calling the recursive nature.

Memorize the ans in DP
Using the DP ans whenever required.
